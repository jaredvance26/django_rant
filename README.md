# django_rant

# Overview


## Rant
I created a basic social media site called "Rant". The website serves the purpose of allowing users to rant about whats going on in their lives. The site allows the user to create an account, and then post. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this website I created was to learn and experement with Django. It was a lot of new information and let me broaden my skills.

# Web Pages

The web pages I used were just a basic home page, signup page, and login page. The home page is where the posts were. It drew the posts from the database and looped then displaying them one by one. The sign up page was just a form that I imported from the Django library. The sign in page was very similar to the sign up page. 

# Development Environment

- Django/Python
- HTML
- CSS 


{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
